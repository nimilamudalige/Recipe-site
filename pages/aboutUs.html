     <h2>Who We Are</h2>  
        <h4>Home cooks are our heroes—it's as simple as that. 
     Allrecipes is a community built by and for kitchen 
    experts: The cooks who will dedicate the weekend to  
    a perfect beef bourguignon but love the simplicity of 
    a slow-cooker rendition, too. The bakers who labor 
    over a showstopping 9-layer cake but will just as happily 
    doctor boxed brownies for a decadent weeknight dessert. 
    The entertainers who just want a solid snack spread, 
    without tons of dirty dishes at the end of the night. 
    Most importantly, Allrecipes connects home cooks with 
    their greatest sources of inspiration — other home cooks. 
    We're the world's leading digital food brand, and that inspires 
     us to do everything possible to keep our community connected. 
     Sixty-million home cooks deserve no less.</h4>
